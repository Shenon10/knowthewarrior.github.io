        <p class="sectag">Mission and Doctrine</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">Initially, the army's main objective was to defend the nation's frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of
            providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in Kashmir and Northeast India. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its special
            forces capabilities. With India's increasing international role, and the requirement to protect its interests in far-off countries becoming important, the
            Indian Army and the Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<br>
            The current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the
            holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the
            holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations would attack at a point of India's choosing. The Indian Army is large
            enough to devote several corps to the strike role.

        <p class="sectag">Know the Warriors</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. The
            President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the
            Chief of Army Staff (COAS). The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and
            have participated in several battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre
            honours before and after Independence.<br>
            The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity, to defend the
            nation from external aggression and internal threats, and to maintain peace and security within its
            borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances,
            such as Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal
            threats. It is a major component of national power, alongside the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force.</p></div>

        <p class="secsubtag">The army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. Other major
            operations undertaken by the army include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, and Operation Cactus.
            The army has conducted large peacetime exercises such as Operation Brasstacks and Exercise Shoorveer,
            and it has also been an active participant in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions, including
            those in Cyprus, Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, Mozambique, South Sudan, and Somalia.<br>
             The army is an all-volunteer force and comprises more than 80% of the
            country's active defence personnel. It is the largest standing army in the world, with 1,237,117
            active troops and 960,000 reserve troops. The army has embarked on an infantry modernisation
            program known as Futuristic Infantry Soldier As a System (F-INSAS), and is also upgrading and
            acquiring new assets for its armoured, artillery, and aviation branches</p></div>
