                <p class="smalltext" style="width: 90%;"> The Indian Army is a voluntary service, and although a provision for military conscription exists in the Indian constitution, conscription has never been
                    imposed. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, in 2020 the army had a strength of 1,237,000 active personnel and 960,000 reserve personnel.
                    Of those in reserve, 300,000 are first-line reserves (within 5 years of active service), 500,000 are committed to return
                    if called until the age of 50, and 160,000 were in the Indian Territorial Army, with 40,000 in regular establishment.
                    This makes the Indian Army the world's largest standing volunteer army.</p><br>

        <p class="secsubtag">The ranks of the Indian Army for the most part follow the British Army tradition.
            Commissioned Officers Commissioned officers are the leaders of the army and command units from
            platoon/company to brigade, division, corps, and above.
            Indian Army officers are continually put through different courses of training, and assessed on merit, for promotions and appointments. Substantive
            promotions up to lieutenant colonel, or equivalent, are based on time in service, whereas those for the colonel and above are based on selection, with
            promotion to colonel being also based on time served.

        <p class="secsubtag">To make themselves less of a target, the forces of the East India Company in
            India dyed their white summer tunics to neutral tones initially a tan called
            khaki (from the Hindi word for "dusty"). This was a temporary measure that
            became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the Second
            Boer War in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on dun for Service
            Dress. The Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.
            The 2006 standard issued camouflage uniform of the Indian Army was the PC-DPM which consists of French
            Camouflage Europe Centrale featuring a forest camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments
            being printed on BDU. The Desert variant issued in 2006 was based on the French Camouflage Daguet printed on
            BDU, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert, and
            desert areas of Rajasthan and its vicinity. Starting in 2022, a digital pixelated camouflage pattern uniform designed by
            NIFT has been adopted, while the uniform style is similar to the US Marine MMCUU uniform.</p></div>

        <p class="secsubtag">The new camouflage pattern retains the mix of colours including olive green and
            earthen, and has been designed keeping in mind aspects like areas of deployment
            of the troops and climatic conditions they operate in. According to the officials, the
            fabric of the new material makes it lighter, sturdier, more breathable, and more
            suitable for the different terrains that the soldiers are posted in.[175]
            The new uniform, unlike the old one, has a combat T-shirt worn underneath and a
            jacket over it. Also unlike the older uniform, the shirt will not be tucked in. The
            jacket has angular top pockets, lower pockets with vertical openings, knife pleats at
            the back, a pocket on the left sleeve & a pen holder on the left forearm, and
            improved-quality buttons. The trousers will be adjustable at the waist with elastic
            and buttons, and has a double layer at the groin. For the caps, the girth will be
            adjustable, and the logo of the Army will be of better quality than earlier.

        <p class="secsubtag"> The new uniforms would not be available in the open market. The uniforms will be
            barcoded and QR coded to maintain their uniqueness, and will be available only
            through the ordnance chain or military canteens. To control random
            proliferation, they will come in over a dozen pre-stitched standard sizes. The new
            uniform will be made available in a phased manner to the nearly 1.2 million
            personnel of the Indian Army.
            The modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by
            variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and
            Garhwal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon, and Naga Regiments wear broad-brimmed hats of traditional style.
            Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the
            Rajputana Rifles), as well as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, wear rank badges, buttons, and wire embroidered articles in black, instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour, as the original role of the rifle regiments was
            camouflage and concealment.

        <p class="secsubtag">The role of women in the Indian Army began when the Indian Military Nursing Service was formed in 1888. Nurses
            served in World Wars I and II, where 350 Indian Army nurses either died, were taken prisoner of war, or declared
            missing in action; this includes nurses who died when SS Kuala was sunk by Japanese Bombers in 1942. In 1992,
            the Indian Army began inducting women officers in non-medical roles.
