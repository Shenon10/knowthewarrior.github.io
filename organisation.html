            General Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Lieutenant General. Each command directly reports
            to Army HQ in New Delhi. These commands are given below in order of creation, with location (city) and commanders listed. There is also the Army
            Training Command abbreviated ARTRAC. Besides these, army officers may head tri-service commands such as the Strategic Forces Command and
            Andaman and Nicobar Command, as well as institutions such as the Integrated Defence Staff.

            are from the Corps of Engineers, Army Medical Corps, or the Army Service Corps. They serve as a part-time reserve.
            On 4 June 2017, the chief of staff announced that the Army was planning to open combat positions to women, who
            would first be appointed to positions in the military police.</p></div>

        <p class="sectag">Infantry</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">Upon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor,
            an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well-trained personnel to the field
            formations. As such, it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres.
            Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they
            are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.<br>
            Most Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as region (for example, the
            Assam Regiment), caste/community (Jat Regiment), or religion (Sikh Regiment). Most regiments continue the
            heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence, some of which have
            specialised in border defence, in particular the Ladakh Scouts, the Arunachal Scouts, and the Sikkim Scouts.<br>
            Over the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the
            regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the Indian union as a whole.
            Thus some "all India" or "all class" regiments have been created, which recruit troops from all over India, regardless of
            region, caste, community, or religion: such as the Brigade of the Guards (which later converted to the Mechanised
            Infantry profile) and the Parachute Regiment.</p></div>

        <p class="secsubtag">Pre-commission training of Gentlemen Cadets is carried out at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and the Officers Training Academy at Chennai.
                There are also specialised training institutions such as the Army War College, at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh; the High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS), at
                Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir; the Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJW), in Vairengte, Mizoram; and the College of Military
                Engineering (CME), in Pune.
                The Army Training Command (ARTRAC), at Shimla, supervises training of personnel.
                In 2020 a 'Tour of Duty' scheme was proposed for voluntary recruitment into the forces for civilians, to enable them to join for three years of short
                service.
             The scheme is on a trial basis and will start with a test group of 100 officers and 1000 jawans.

        <p class="sectag">Intelligence</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">The Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) is an intelligence-gathering arm of the Indian Army. The MI (as it is commonly
            referred to) was constituted in 1941. It was initially created to check corruption in the Army's ranks. With time, its role has evolved
            into cross-border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups, and counter-terrorism.
            In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the Samba spy scandal, wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as
            Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime intelligence organisation of the Indian Army.
            As of 2012, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away by the newly created National Technical Research Organisation and the
            Defence Intelligence Agency.
            Since it was set up in 2004 as a premier scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in
            the Prime Minister's Office, it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the
            first of its kind in Asia.
