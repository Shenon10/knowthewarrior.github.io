        <p class="sectag">During British Raj</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">In 1776, a Military Department was created within the government of
            the East India Company at Kolkata. Its main function was to record
            orders that were issued to the army by various departments of the
            East India Company for the territories under its control.
            With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the government of the
            East India Company was reorganised into four departments,
            including a Military Department. The army in the presidencies of
            Bengal, Bombay and Madras functioned as respective Presidency
            Armies until 1 April 1895, when they were unified into a single force
            known as the Indian Army. For administrative
            convenience, it was divided into four commands, namely Punjab
            (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including
            Burma), and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).
            The British Indian Army was a critical force for maintaining the
            primacy of the British Empire, both in India and throughout the
            world. Besides maintaining the internal security of the British Raj, the
            Army fought in many other theatres: the Anglo-Burmese Wars; the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars; the
            First, Second, and Third Anglo-Afghan wars; the First and Second opium wars, and the Boxer Rebellion
            in China; and in Abyssinia.

        <p class="sectag">During World War</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">In the 20th century, the British
            Indian Army was a crucial adjunct to British forces in both world wars. 1.3 million Indian soldiers served
            in World War I (1914-1918) with the Allies, in which 74,187 Indian troops were killed or missing in
            action.[22] In 1915 there was a mutiny by Indian soldiers in Singapore. The United Kingdom made
            promises of self-governance to the Indian National Congress in return for its support but reneged on
            them after the war, following which the Indian Independence movement gained strength.<br>
            The "Indianisation" of the British Indian Army began with the formation of the Prince of Wales Royal
            Indian Military College at Dehradun, in March 1912, to provide education to the scions of aristocratic and
            well-to-do Indian families and to prepare selected Indian boys for admission into the Royal Military
            College, Sandhurst. Cadets were given a King's commission, after passing out, and were posted to one of
            the eight units selected for Indianisation. Because of the slow pace of Indianisation, with just 69 officers
            being commissioned between 1918 and 1932, political pressure was applied, leading to the formation of
            the Indian Military Academy in 1932 and greater numbers of officers of Indian origin being
            commissioned. On the eve of World War II, the officer corps consisted of roughly 500 Indians holding
            regular commissions against approximately 3,000 British officers.<br>In World War II Indian soldiers fought alongside the Allies. In 1939, British officials had no plan for
            expansion and training of Indian forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition there were
            44,000 men in British units in India in 1939), whose mission was internal security and defence against a
            possible Soviet threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army
            expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battlefronts as soon as possible. The most serious
            problem was the lack of equipment.[25] Indian units served in Burma, wherein 1944-45, five Indian
            divisions were engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated
            in the Middle East. Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. By the end of the war, it had become the
            largest volunteer army in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945</p></div>

        <p class="secsubtag">In the African and Middle East campaigns, captured Indian troops were given a choice to join the German
            Army, to eventually "liberate" India from Great Britain, instead of being sent to POW camps. These men,
            along with Indian students who were in Germany when the war broke out, made up what was called the
            Free India Legion. They were originally intended as pathfinders for German forces in Asia but were soon
            sent to help guard the Atlantic Wall. Few who were part of the Free India Legion ever saw any combat,
            and very few were ever stationed outside Europe. At its height, the Free India Legion had over 3,000
            troops in its ranks.<br>
            Indian POWs also joined the Indian National Army, which was allied with the Empire of Japan. It was
            raised by a former colonel of the British Indian Army, General Mohan Singh, but was later led by Subhas
            Chandra Bose and Rash Bihari Bose. With the fall of Singapore in 1942, about 40,000 Indian soldiers
            were captured. When given the choice, over 30,000 joined the Indian National Army. Those who refused
            became POWs and were mostly shipped to New Guinea. After initial success, this army was defeated,
            along with the Japanese; but it had a huge impact on the Indian independence movement.</p></div>

        <p class="sectag">During Independence</p>
        <p class="secsubtag">Upon the Partition of India and Indian independence in 1947, four of the ten Gurkha regiments were
            transferred to the British Army. The rest of the British Indian Army was divided between the newly
            created nations of India and Pakistan. The Punjab Boundary Force, which had been formed to help police
            Punjab during the partition period, was disbanded. Headquarters Delhi and the East Punjab
            Command were formed to administer the area.
            The departure of virtually all senior British officers following independence, and their replacement by Indian officers,
            meant many of the latter held acting ranks several ranks above their substantive ones. For instance, S. M. Shrinagesh,
            the ground-forces commander of Indian forces during the first Indo-Pak War of 1947-49 (and the future third COAS),
            was first an acting major-general and then an acting lieutenant-general during the conflict while holding the
            substantive rank of major, and only received a substantive promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1949. Gopal
            Gurunath Bewoor, the future ninth COAS, was an acting colonel at his promotion to substantive major from
            substantive captain in 1949, while future Lieutenant General K. P. Candeth was an acting brigadier (substantive
            captain) at the same time. In April 1948, the former Viceroy's Commissioned Officers (VCO) were re-designated
            Junior Commissioned Officers, while the former King's Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIO) and Indian
            Commissioned Officers (ICO), along with the former Indian Other Ranks (IOR), were respectively re-designated as
            Officers and Other Ranks.
